## Motivation
* Almost all restaurants have review system to take input from their customers about food and services. Here, a customer either writes about their experience or gives star ratings.
* In general, textual data hold crucial information about customer experience, even causality for star ratings. 
Currently, there isn't any system to validate the reviews i.e. whether a customer is writing proper reviews related to their restaurant experience.
* For example, I can write anything rubbish which is not related to my restaurant experience *(for instance, "xyz", "qwertyjafjwebfliu", "I like to play cricket")* and can submit my review.This limits a restaurants ability to focus on their areas of improvement.
* This project nudges customers to write relevant reviews using **_Natural Language Processing_** and **_Machine Learning_** with end-to-end API call using _Flask_ & _Python_.
* Furthermore, it classifies the reviews into _Positive_, _Negative_ & _Irrelevant_ reviews. Thus, helping restaurants to get insights on customer experience.
